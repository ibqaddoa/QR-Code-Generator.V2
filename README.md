# QR-Code-Generator.v2

My second attempt on trying to evolve the QR-Code-Generator App after my liking. Therefore using the gained knowlege from the Udemy course: "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" mixed with the follow along of the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kawVrK4v7Os.

The App should be able to take in three fundamental information of a person. For example name, familyname and phone number and turn it into a QR-Code so it can be scanned for instance at a restaurant or a cafe.

NEXT STEPS:

-Provide auto layout for other iOS devices      
-Make the form more user friendly     
-Easy keyboard managment for the user     
      
-Make it possible to save the QR-Code. Therefore the information doesn't have to be typed in everytime you open the app.
